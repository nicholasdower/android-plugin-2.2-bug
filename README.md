Demonstrates a bug in com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.0. Run:

```
./gradlew clean :app:testDebug
```

Notice the build fails with:

```
File '...testlibrary/build/outputs/aar/testlibrary-release.aar' specified for property 'bundle' does not exist.
```

testlibrary-release.aar should be generated by :testlibrary:bundleRelease. Normally :app:prepareAndroidBundleBugTestlibraryUnspecifiedLibrary would depend on :testlibrary:bundleRelease but it does not.

The following works:

```
./gradlew clean :testlibrary:bundleRelease && ./gradlew :app:testDebug
```
